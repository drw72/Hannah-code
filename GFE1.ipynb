#This script does the following:
#Generates a synthetic dataset: It creates a dataset with 25 features, where 5 are informative, and 2 are redundant.
#Splits the dataset: It divides the dataset into a training set and a test set.
#Initializes and fits RFE: It uses a logistic regression model for feature ranking and selection, specifying to select 5 features.
#Evaluates the model: It calculates and prints the accuracy of the model on the test set.
#Plots feature importance: It creates a bar plot showing the ranking of features according to their importance in prediction, as determined by RFE.
#Identifies selected features: It prints the indices of the features that were selected by RFE as most important.
